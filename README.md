## Created by:
### Supriya Sthapit Sherpa

## Project description
### This project analyzes the responses from a class survey conducted among WashU's Brown School MPH students enrolled in the advanced data analysis class in Fall 2024. The class instructor Dr. Kim Johnson administered the survey at the beginning of the course. The dataset includes information on the student's country of origin, birth date and month, favorite hobbies, food, and seasons, and coding experience. Their project explores the relationships between these variables, for example, the percentage of students who prefer the season they were born in, and median birth dates.

### Date of data collection: August 2024
### Target population: MPH students enrolled in the 'Advanced Data Analysis' Fall 2024 class, Brown School, WashU

## Why is this project useful?
### Firstly, this project provides an insight into the student's educational background and personal details. It also provides some information on student's preferences and their experience with using statistical software. Therefore, this project may be useful for the instructor to better understand their students at a personal level. Moreover, since it also informs the instructor about the students' R skill level, it might serve as a base for modifying the course structure as per the skill level of the majority of the students. Lastly, the students can use this project to learn about their classmates.
