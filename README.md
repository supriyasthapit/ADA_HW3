# Class 1 Survey Analysis Code
## Project description
### This project analyzes the responses from a class survey conducted among WashU's Brown School MPH students enrolled in the advanced data analysis class in Fall 2024. The class instructor Dr. Kim Johnson administered the survey at the beginning of the course. The dataset includes information on the student's country of origin, birth date and month, favorite hobbies, food, and seasons, and coding experience. Their project explores the relationships between these variables, for example, the percentage of students who prefer the season they were born in, and median birth dates.
